                    <p>If you're reading this, it means that you have decided that you want to make a change. It means that you have identified a problem and are looking for a solution. Keeping these factors in mind is going to be important as you begin your journey towards a life of financial strength.</p>

                    <h3 class="subhead">it's usual to feel bad</h3>
                    <p>It's likely that you don't feel very good at the moment. Debt has weird effects on people. Not only does it contaminate your financial life, but it impacts on your relationships with people, affects decision-making and manifests physically in stress. Sleepless nights, cold sweats, feeling like you're carrying a rock in your stomach - these sensations are not uncommon for people in debt.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3 class="subhead">have hope</h3>
                    <p>The good news is that none of this is permanent. A life without debt and its consequences is possible for anyone willing to make a change. Before you begin, however, follow these initial steps:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Take a look at the image of the flower on this page and imagine how it smells</li>
                            <li>Through your nose, take in a deep breath whilst counting to 5 in your head</li>
                            <li>Hold your breath for 5 more counts</li>
                            <li>Through your mouth, breath out slowly over another 5</li>
                            <li>Repeat as often as necessary if you begin to feel overwhelmed</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3 class="subhead">let's begin</h3>
