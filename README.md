    On devices with the full navigation bar displayed, page names change colour when the user hovers with a mouse.

+ **Hero Image** - The Welcome page opens with a large image of a flower. The purpose is to greet a vistor with a calming picture that puts users in mind of a garden. The overlay text uses level 2 headings to clearly articulate the purpose of the website.

+ **Text Content** - The text is organised into four introductory paragraphs, each titled using a level 3 heading. The purpose of each paragraph is to:
    - **Welcome** - show the user that we understand why they are here
    - **It's usual to feel bad** - show empathy for users who might be in a heightened emotional state
    - **Have hope** - provide a hopeful message and list the steps of a breathing exercise to help users relax
    - **Let's begin** - provide direction for using the rest of the website

    *Welcome page paragraphs*

    The headings have been styled using the same font face and colour as the site logo to provide consistancey. A declaration has been applied to the paragraphs and list elements to adjust the line height and allow the text to breath.

+ **Footer** - The footer contains links to popular social media websites. Each link opens in a new tab and is aria labelled for accessibility purposes. These icons follow the same hover rules as the main navigation links.

### Steps Page
+ **Bridge Metaphor Image** - The image of the bridge provides visual clarification that the user is on a new page. The bridge is in a garden, building on the Garden theme established with the Welcome page. The bridge also represents crossing over from one place to another. As the user follows the steps to get out of debt, they too should cross a divide. The red font highlighting the user's curent page was colour picked from this image to provide consistancy.

+ **Internal Navigation** - To aid the user in moving around the page, internal navigation links have been provided beneath the metaphor image. These links use upper case lettering to distinguish them form the main site navigation links. The font face and colour match that of the sections to which they relate. The links obey the same hover rules as the other navigation links.

+ **Text Content** - The text is divided into the following sections:
    - Behaviour
    - Principles
    - Process

    The purpose to these sections is to promote a behaviour shift by encouraging a principles-based approach to getting out of debt.

    *Principles sections*

    <img src="assets/screenshots/process.png" alt="process section screenshot">

    *Process section*

    Each section has font faces and colour schemes consistant with those already introduced. Line spacing is also consistant. The slight differences in styling from one section to another - red font within Principles and numbered list with green font within Process - enables the user to visually distinguish one section from another.

+ **Metaphor Images** - This page also includes a number of metaphor images. These images continue to build the Garden theme and provide visual representations of the ideas described. The lantern acts as a guiding light to represent principles. The two chairs surrounded by utensils represents two people sitting together to plan their process. The ladder represents beginning work and moving upwards out of debt. As users select the Principles and Process internal navigation links, the page will jump to the metaphor image preceeding the text.
