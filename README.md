    On devices with the full navigation bar displayed, page names change colour when the user hovers with a mouse.

+ **Hero Image** - The Welcome page opens with a large image of a flower. The purpose is to greet a vistor with a calming picture that puts users in mind of a garden. The overlay text uses level 2 headings to clearly articulate the purpose of the website.

+ **Text Content** - The text is organised into four introductory paragraphs, each titled using a level 3 heading. The purpose of each paragraph is to:
    - **Welcome** - show the user that we understand why they are here
    - **It's usual to feel bad** - show empathy for users who might be in a heightened emotional state
    - **Have hope** - provide a hopeful message and list the steps of a breathing exercise to help users relax
    - **Let's begin** - provide direction for using the rest of the website

    *Welcome page paragraphs*

    The headings have been styled using the same font face and colour as the site logo to provide consistancey. A declaration has been applied to the paragraphs and list elements to adjust the line height and allow the text to breath.

+ **Footer** - The footer contains links to popular social media websites. Each link opens in a new tab and is aria labelled for accessibility purposes. These icons follow the same hover rules as the main navigation links.

### Steps Page
+ **Bridge Metaphor Image** - The image of the bridge provides visual clarification that the user is on a new page. The bridge is in a garden, building on the Garden theme established with the Welcome page. The bridge also represents crossing over from one place to another. As the user follows the steps to get out of debt, they too should cross a divide. The red font highlighting the user's curent page was colour picked from this image to provide consistancy.

    *Screenshot of the Bridge metaphor image*

+ **Internal Navigation** - To aid the user in moving around the page, internal navigation links have been provided beneath the metaphor image. These links use upper case lettering to distinguish them form the main site navigation links. The font face and colour match that of the sections to which they relate. The links obey the same hover rules as the other navigation links.

    *Internal navigation links*

+ **Text Content** - The text is divided into the following sections:
    - Behaviour
    - Principles
    - Process

    The purpose to these sections is to promote a behaviour shift by encouraging a principles-based approach to getting out of debt.

    *Principles sections*

    <img src="assets/screenshots/process.png" alt="process section screenshot">

    *Process section*

    Each section has font faces and colour schemes consistant with those already introduced. Line spacing is also consistant. The slight differences in styling from one section to another - red font within Principles and a numbered list with green font within Process - enables the user to visually distinguish one section from another.

+ **Metaphor Images** - This page also includes a number of metaphor images. These images continue to build the Garden theme and provide visual representations of the ideas described. The lantern acts as a guiding light to represent principles. The two chairs surrounded by utensils represents two people sitting together to plan their process. The ladder represents beginning work and moving upwards out of debt. As users select the Principles and Process internal navigation links, the page will jump to the metaphor image preceeding the text.

### Resources Page
+ **Signup Form** - This page gives users the opportunity to complete a form and sign-up for a newsletter. The form includes:
    - Required text fields for first and last names
    - Required email field
    - Required debt status radio button selector
    - Submit button syled with 'Sign Up' text

    All the form elements are labeled and the first option in the set of radio buttons is pre-selected to teach users what to do. The translucent backround and submit button have been syled in keeping with the website's colour palette.

    *Form on screen sizes between 400px and 768px*
 
+ **External Links** - This page also gives users the opportunity to quickly access external resources that may be useful when managing debt. These resources are categorised as follows:
    - **Budgeting** - links to videos and text-based resources on how to budget
    - **Motivation** - links to a video playlist of people telling thier debt stories and a website made by someone who removed debt from thier life
    - **Community** - links to online forums populated by others working thier way out of debt
    - **Legal** - links to websites that provide information about debt and the law

    The links section appears within a transluscent backgound to match that of the form. The links change colour when hovered over with a cursor on larger screen sizes. The colour this time, however, is a shade of green rather than beige. This allows for sufficeinet contrast between the base font colour and the hover colour and keeps the styling within a consistant colour palette. All of the links will open in a new tab and are aria labelled for accessibility purposes.

    *Form and links sections on screen sizes above 768px*

+ **Metaphor Images** - Depending on the screen size used, users will see either one or two metaphore images. On mobile screens and others up to 768px, the image behind the form is that of a garden path ascending some steps (as seen above). The image behind the links section is that of a hand holding a seedling (also see above). On screens above 768px, only the seedling image is displayed. Both images are in keeping with the Garden theme. The path represents 'next steps' for the user - sign-up for our newsletter and continue your debt-free journey with us. The seedling represents new personal growth which can be nurtured using the links provided.

## Development Steps
The website was developed using a mobile-first appraoch coupled with the five planes of User Centred Design (UCD). UCD focuses on designing products that are useful, usable and valuable, that create a positive emotional response. This was the challenge. 

The sections below detail the five planes on UCD and how they were applied within the Debt Deliverance Website development process.


### Strategy

The purpose of the Strategy step is to understand, at a high level, what it is we want to acheive. In my instance, I wanted to develop a website that would act as a first port of call for someone strugglimg with debt. Some basic research showed that internet traffic

## Testing

This website employed a mixture of both in-process testing and appraisals of the finished product. Testing made use of both quantitative and qualitative methods. In-process testing was used to inform design decisions for both styling and website functionality. Appraislas were used to confirm that the website met with criteria for Accessibility, Performance, Best Practice, SEO and Validation. Full appraisal results are detailed below along with a sample of in-process test results, bugs found and fixes deployed.
