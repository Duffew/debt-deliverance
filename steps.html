                <h3 class="subhead">Behaviour matters</h3>
                <p>One of the hardest parts of my own journey to financial freedom was fully understanding that it was my responsibility. My background didn't matter, my upbringing didn't matter, my social class didn't matter, my gender didn't matter; nothing mattered other than my behaviour. The decisions that I had made, which then manifested as actions in the world, had put me in debt. Nothing else. My behaviour was responsible for my circumstances and I was responsible for my behaviour. At that moment, my debt became the symptom, not the problem. My REAL problem was that my behaviour was bad. If I wanted to be free of debt, then I needed better behaviour, and so do you.</p>

            <div id="principles">
                <h3 class="subhead">principles</h3>
                <p>In order to guide your behaviour, you must adopt a set principles to provide you with direction when things get difficult. There will be moments in your journey when you will be prompted with choices and will need to make good decisions. Reactive decisions, taken in the heat of the moment and based upon what feels good at the time, are rarely good decisions. Decisions made proactivly from a point of principle, are usully better, provided the principles are sound.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The inspiration for guiding principles can come from a range of sources but the principles you choose for your journey should be set when you are at peace with yourself. By setting principles when you are in a stable state of mind, you can have more confidence in your decision making when life becomes more turbulent. You may wish to develop a set of finincial principles as you learn to manage your money. If you would like some ideas to begin with, these are principles I have adopted since determining to deal my debt in 2002. Not only did they help me to climb out of debt, but they have also guided my progress towards building wealth.</p>
