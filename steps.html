                        <p>One of the hardest parts of my own journey to financial freedom was fully understanding that
                            it was my responsibility. My background didn't matter, my upbringing didn't matter, my
                            social class didn't matter, my gender didn't matter; nothing mattered other than my
                            behaviour. The decisions that I had made, which then manifested as actions in the world, had
                            put me in debt. Nothing else. My behaviour was responsible for my circumstances and I was
                            responsible for my behaviour. At that moment, my debt became the symptom, not the problem.
                            My REAL problem was that my behaviour was bad. If I wanted to be free of debt, then I needed
                            better behaviour, and so do you.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="principles">
                        <h3 class="subhead">principles</h3>
                        <p>In order to guide your behaviour, you must adopt a set principles to provide you with
                            direction when things get tough. There will be times when you will need to make hard choices
                            and good decisions. Reactive decisions, taken in the heat of the moment and based upon what
                            feels good at the time, are rarely good ones. Decisions made proactivly from a point of
                            principle, are usully better, provided the principles are sound.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>So what might a set of principles for getting out of debt look like? You may want to develop
                            your own over time as you learn to manage your money, but to get you started, the following
                            may be helpful:</p>
                        <br>
                        <div class="steps-list">
                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="list-intro">Do not borrow money, ever</span>
                                    <p>If you don't have the money to pay for somthing in full,
                                    then you can't afford it and you do not buy it. This means no borrowing on credit
                                    cards, no car loans, no student loans, no personal loans, no familly loans. The
                                    borrower is always slave to the lender and part of the stress you feel is the
                                    reality of this dynamic. You're here because you have debt. Stop borrowing money
                                    now. Cut up your credit cards and do not take a consolidation loan. More loans are
                                    not the solution to debt; changing your behaviour is.</p></li>
                                    <br>
                                <li><span class="list-intro">Write it down</span>
                                    <p>To be sucessful with money, you must use a written budget. The
                                    budget should include: a clearly stated purpose at the top of the page; the
                                    timeframe it covers; your projected income over that timeframe; your essentail
                                    expenses then non-essential expenses; a list of any assets followed by a list of
                                    your debts. Then, subtract your projected expenses from your income to show that
                                    there is money left over. If there isn't, you either need to increase your income or
                                    cut your expenses, preferably both. A written budget serves two purposes. Firstly it
                                    shows you the reality of your financial situation, and secondly gives you
                                    accountability. The budget is your plan. You wrote it, now you stick to it.</p></li>
                                    <br>
                                <li><span class="list-intro">Behaviour matters, be deliberate</span><p>Most of the people I know who have or had debt,
                                    myself included, drifted into it. It wasn't planned ahead of time. More often than
                                    not, it was a childish reaction to life's events. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) or
                                    worry about what others might think prompt terrible financial decisions. 'My friend
                                    wants to get married in Bali and I have no money. What will my friend think of I say
                                    no? I'll put the trip on the credit card.' Or 'I can't turn up to work in an old
                                    car, what will my colleagues say? I'll take a loan on a new car.' When loans are on
                                    offer with almost any purchse in today's world, wandering in to debt, to placate our
                                    feelings, is very easy. You cannot, however, wander out. You must make a deliberate
                                    decision every day to live within your means. You will need to say 'No' to yourself
                                    and, far harder, you will need to say 'No' to your friends and family. This will be
                                    the toughest part, so be prepared and stick to your principles.</p></li>
                                    <br>
                                <li><span class="list-intro">Get the sequence right</span><p>Life is full of tasks that we need to complete. The order
                                    in which we do these tasks has a dramatic effect on the likelihood of a successful
                                    outcome. You don't put your shoes on before your socks because that would be silly.
                                    You follow the right, logical sequence and your feet have a comfortable day.
                                    Similarly, there is a logical sequence for paying off debt. Following the sequence,
                                    detailed below, will lead to success.</p></li>
                                    <br>

                        </div>
                        <p>The above principles are a useful starting point, not only for managing debt, but also for
                            building wealth after debt. They can be used to help you keep control of your finances
                            throughout your lifetime and with consistant application can turn managing money into a
                            satisfying activity rather than a sorrowful one.

                        <p>Pre-requisites - marriages and civil partnerships:</p>
                        <br>
                        <ul class="steps-list">
                            <li>You must have life insurance, particularly if you have children. You should also have
                                insurance for your house, car and consider insurance for loss of income or long-term
                                disability. You must protect yourself and those you love from financial loss in the
                                event of the unexpected.</li>
                            <li>You will only do this successfully if you combine finances. Your debts are both your
                                debts, and your incomes are both your incomes. Complete transparency and trust are
                                required and to that end, one joint current account into which and from which all money
                                flows. That doesn't mean you keep separate current accounts and each contribute to a
                                joint account for the bills. One joint account only for everything.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>Without these pre-requisites, your task will be immeasurably harder. If you are married or in
                            a civil partnership, you must work together and provision for each other if one of you is
                            incapacitated or lost. The following sequence should be taken together and in complete
                            agreement.

                        <h4>steps for getting out of debt</h4>
                        <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Choose a start date</h4> You will need a few hours to work through these steps so
                                agree a date and time when you are able to focus on just this. My wife and I set aside
                                Sunday mornings for a family meeting every week where we discuss everything from
                                finances to who's cooking what for dinner on which day. Go somewhere outside the house
                                so the temptation to 'just put the laundry on' is removed. If you have young children,
                                ask someone look after them for a couple of hours. You need to get used to being
                                deliberate about managing your money. Set time aside for it.
                            </li>
                            <li>Write a vision statement - this is your written statement about why you want to be out
                                of debt. It is a vision of what life looks like without debt. It could be you want to
                                stop worrying about the bills; you want to reduce stress levels so you can enjoy time
                                with the people you love; you want to build long-term wealth to provide for a dignified
                                retirement. Whatever the reason for tackling your debt, it needs to be larger than the
                                debt itself and worthwhile enough to keep you moving towards it. It doesn't need to be
                                detailed, just a sentence or two but it needs to be written down and agreed.</li>
                            <li>Cut up your credit cards - this will be harder to do than it seems as our emotional
                                attachment to these small pieces of plastic can be very strong, but is an important
                                practical and symbolic step. You should also remove any credit card information stored
                                in your web browser making the 'One Click Purchase' much harder. From this moment, you
                                buy nothing unless you have the money to pay for it in your current account. This is
                                going to help you develop good habits by encourage you to keep a close eye on your bank
                                account and check that you have the money before you buy things.</li>
                            <li>List all your debts - write down every debt you have starting with smallest at the top
                                of the page and the largest at the bottom. Include the type, company owed, amount and
                                monthly payment but exclude your mortgage. Then total up the full amount outstanding and
                                the total monthly payment. This is the full scope of your battle. The way to win is to
                                focus your attention on the smallest debt first. Pay the minimum on everything else but
                                get the smallest paid off quickly and the feeling of success will provide positive
                                reinforcement for your good behaviour and propel you onto the next fight. By the time
                                you hit the bottom of the page, momentum and renewed self-belief will make short work of
                                your largest debt. The sequence here is important. Don't go for the highest interest
                                rate first or the largest monthly payment first. Start with the smallest debt and get
                                some quick wins.</li>
                            <li>List all your assets - make a list of everything you own that has a cash value. Include
                                cash in bank accounts, investment accounts, cars, precious metals, expensive
                                electronics, bicycles, and anything else that you might be able to sell, but do not
                                include any private pensions. You need to keep £1,000 aside in a savings account for a
                                basic emergency fund, but beyond that, you sell everything that is not essential. If you
                                don't have any cash at all, then you are selling things to raise £1,000 first. You will
                                likely find selling off assets difficult. If you do, compare your list of assets with
                                your Vision Statement. Put them side by side. Which is more important? If it's the asset
                                list, you need a bigger vision.</li>
                            <li>Write your budget - Writing a budget is a skill that takes time to develop so don't
                                worry if you find this difficult at first. The more you do it, the better you'll get.
                                The key is that once it is written, you stick to it. The budget is your planned spending
                                for the month based upon your projected income for the month. To write the budget, start
                                at the top of the page with your estimated income for that month. Next, list your
                                essential expenses only followed by 3 columns titled ESTIMATE, ACTUAL and BALANCE and
                                assign each category an amount in the ESTIMATE column. The total of the ESTIMATE column
                                is equal to your income. The categories for essential expenses are: food and household,
                                utilities, rent or mortgage, council tax, transportation and debt payments. Whilst you
                                are in debt, these are the only line items you need. You are not taking holidays. You
                                are not eating in restaurants or going to the pub. You are not going to the cinema or
                                buying expensive clothes. There are no non-essential expenses. You are on a subsistence
                                lifestyle until the debt is gone. Track your spending and take a few minutes at the end
                                of every day to update your ACTUAL and BALANCE columns on your budget ensuring that you
                                stay within your ESTIMATE. Do a weekly review of your progress and write a new budget
                                each month.</li>
                            <li>Get to work - Cancel your streaming subscriptions and pick up an evening job, you need
                                the extra income to bring forward your debt free date and you won't be having evenings
                                out. Pick up some shifts in a pub or restaurant; deliver pizza or drive for Uber. Do
                                something to bring in extra money. Its only for a short time but while you have debt
                                your life should consist of working, sleeping and paying off debt and that is it. Keep
                                your Vision centred in your mind and get to it.</li>

                        <p>The above steps are your blueprint for freeing yourself from debt and laying the foundations
                            for building wealth. The steps represent a principles-based approach to changing your
                            behaviour, that, if followed will give you financial peace of mind throughout your life. My
                            part was to outline the steps and the principles behind them in order to give you hope that
                            you can take control of your life. Your part is do it and you can! Get to work!
