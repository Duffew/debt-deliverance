                <h3 class="subhead">Behaviour matters</h3>
                <p>One of the hardest parts of my own journey to financial freedom was fully understanding that it was my responsibility. My background didn't matter, my upbringing didn't matter, my social class didn't matter, my gender didn't matter; nothing mattered other than my behaviour. The decisions that I had made, which then manifested as actions in the world, had put me in debt. Nothing else. My behaviour was responsible for my circumstances and I was responsible for my behaviour. At that moment, my debt became the symptom, not the problem. My REAL problem was that my behaviour was bad. If I wanted to be free of debt, then I needed better behaviour, and so do you.</p>
                <p></p>
            </div>
            <div id="principles">
                <h3 class="subhead">principles</h3>
                <p>In order to guide your behaviour, you must adopt a set principles to provide you with direction when things get tough. There will be times when you will need to make hard choices and good decisions. Reactive decisions, taken in the heat of the moment and based upon what feels good at the time, are rarely good ones. Decisions made proactivly from a point of principle, are usully better, provided the principles are sound.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So what might a set of principles for getting out of debt look like? You may want to develop your own over time as you learn to manage your money, but to get you started, the following may be helpful:</p>
                <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do not borrow money, ever - If you don't have the money to pay for somthing in full, then you can't afford it and you do not buy it. This means no borrowing on credit cards, no car loans, no student loans, no personal loans, no familly loans. The borrower is always slave to the lender and part of the stress you feel is the reality of this dynamic. You're here because you have debt. Stop borrowing money now. Cut up your credit cards and do not take a consolidation loan. More loans are not the solution to debt; changing your behaviour is.</li>
                        <li>Write it down - To be sucessful with money, you must use a written budget. The budget should include: a clearly stated purpose at the top of the page; the timeframe it covers; your projected income over that timeframe; your essentail expenses then non-essential expenses; a list of any assets followed by a list of your debts. Then, subtract your projected expenses from your income to show that there is money left over. If there isn't, you either need to increase your income or cut your expenses, preferably both. A written budget serves two purposes. Firstly it shows you the reality of your financial situation, and secondly gives you accountability. The budget is your plan. You wrote it, now you stick to it.</li>
                        <li>Behaviour matters, be deliberate - Most of the people I know who have or had debt, myself included, drifted into it. It wasn't planned ahead of time. More often than not, it was a childish reaction to life's events. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) or worry about what others might think prompt terrible financial decisions. 'My friend wants to get married in Bali and I have no money. What will my friend think of I say no? I'll put the trip on the credit card.' Or 'I can't turn up to work in an old car, what will my colleagues say? I'll take a loan on a new car.' When loans are on offer with almost any purchse in today's world, wandering in to debt, to placate our feelings, is very easy. You cannot, however, wander out. You must make a deliberate decision every day to live within your means. You will need to say 'No' to yourself and, far harder, you will need to say 'No' to your friends and family. This will be the toughest part, so be prepared and stick to your principles.</li>
                        <li>Get the sequence right - Life is full of tasks that we need to complete. The order in which we do these tasks has a dramatic effect on the likelihood of a successful outcome. You don't put your shoes on before your socks because that would be silly. You follow the right, logical sequence and your feet have a comfortable day. Similarly, there is a logical sequence for paying off debt. Following the sequence, detailed below, will lead to success.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                <p>The above principles are a useful starting point, not only for managing debt, but also for building wealth after debt. They can be used to help you keep control of your finances throughout your lifetime and with consistant application can turn managing money into a satisfying activity rather than a sorrowful one.</p>
